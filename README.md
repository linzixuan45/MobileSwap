# MobileSwap

The code will be released

In this work, we propose a real-time, lightweight, and high-quality facelift model called MobileSwap. Unlike most models that achieve facial exchange by designing complex network structures and loss functions, our MobileSwap can better decouple identity and background information while only using simple network structures and loss functions, thereby generating higher quality exchanged faces
